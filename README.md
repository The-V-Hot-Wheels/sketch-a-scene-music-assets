# Music assets for Sketch-A-Scene

These are the music assets for Sketch-A-Scene.

Compositions we will need:

- Studio fanfare. Maybe something by Antonio Salieri.
- Timing music and end credits music for the following genres:
  - Action
    - Maybe Wagner, Prelude to Act I of *Die Walk&uuml;re* for timing music.
    - Maybe something vaguely like Star Wars for end credits music.
  - Comedy
  - Drama
  - Horror
    - Maybe something atonal for both timing music and end credits music.
